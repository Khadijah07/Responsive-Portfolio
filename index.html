                    Web Developer with a background in Political Science. I have previous experience writing
                    case studies on various countries and their political structures. I used critical
                    thinking to distinguish what power structures aided in a countries success or demise.
                    I believe those skills show my eagerness to adapt to different programming languages.
                    I earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from Southern-Methodist University,
                    the program focused on helping me develop skills in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The atmosphere
                    of the program aided me in strengthening my skills in teamwork, problem solving, and innovation.
                    My goal is to develop engaging apps with clean interfaces, whilst keeping in mind the userâ€™s
                    security concerns.
                    Which is why I am also currently enrolled in a cyber security certification program. I believe
                    that
                    both
                    my web development and cybersecurity skills combined with my problem-solving and innovative
                    approach make me an advantageous candidate.
